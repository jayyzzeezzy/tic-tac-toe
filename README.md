# Tic Tac Toe

![Demo Screenshot](tic-tac-toe.PNG)

## Description

The purpose of this web app is to implement alternative ways to organize code in JavaScript.

In this app, I used factory functions to generate objects. This is one of the alternative method in contrast to the class method. I practiced this organization method because it allows me to read more code written in different styles.
